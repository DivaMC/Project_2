Objective 1 - Global Map
You are tasked to create a world map to gain an appreciation for where the most occurrences of COVID-19 confirmations and deaths are located.

Create this map using leaflet for the most recent date as shown below. For this map, sum the confirmations and deaths of provinces into one value to depict the total number for the country they belong to. When creating a marker for each country in the map, calculate lat and long as the mean values for the provinces that make up each country.

Customize the map to reflect the differences in magnitude for confirmations and deaths. In the example map below, circle markers that are blue represent low values, gray represents neutral values, and red represents high values. Low, middle, and high values were categorized to aesthetically map the markers based on their probabilistic distribution using the quartile function. You may use any method you like so that it is logical and allows visualization of value intensity. As well, customize the map to include hover labels that indicate country names and popup labels to show the value of confirmations and deaths for that country. For extra help using leaflet, consult this website along with the information provided in your textbooks.




```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
